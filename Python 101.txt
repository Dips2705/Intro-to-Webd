Introduction to Python

1. Hello World program.
print("Hello World")
2. take input and print it
    No data type needed. Fun language!!
    Executes line wise
3. Arithmetic operations: make a calculator
    Default input is taken in string format
    else if in C++ is elif in python
    no semicolons at the end of each line
    colon at the end of if condition
    comment is made by using # at the start of the line
4. Loops
    for j in range(2,90): 
    90 is not displayed.
    for single line display print(j,end="")
    String cant be concatenated with string, to resolve this, convert int to string
5. Functions
    def cube(n):
          ans=n*n*n
          return ans
    multiline comment: use """ at start and end
6. Arrays 
    no need of specifying size
    runs=[1,2,3]
    for i in range(0,4):    (also) for i in runs: *This command enables to run thru the length of the array without any condition*
    .....
    runs.append("xy")  It adds another element to the array
    len(array name) gives the size of the array
    print(array1+array2) gives merged array
7. Strings
    split("<ch>") will split the string on all occurences of <ch>  and store the rest of the split string in an array
8. Maths library
    from math import *
    from math import sqrt as lol (used to give an alias)
9. find tag finds the first instance and stops
    find_all  finds all the instances
